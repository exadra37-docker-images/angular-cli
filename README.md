# ANGULAR CLI

This Docker Image will be used for building Docker Containers to develop Angular Apps with the Angular CLI.

I am shipping it with a Docker Compose file so that we can also use this image to play with Angular CLI itself, Node and NPM.

Please see [How to Use](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-docker-images/angular-cli/blob/master/docs/how-to/use.md) for more details.
