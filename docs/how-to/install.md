# HOW TO INSTALL


## STEP 1

In your computer workspace create a folder for your project:

```mkdir
mkdir -p ~/Developer/Acme/Angular2/HelloApp/docker ~/Developer/Acme/Angular2/HelloApp/workspace
```

Adjust paths to suite your preferences, but remember to update also them in any other later instruction.

## STEP 2

Let's go inside our HelloApp folder.

```shell
cd ~/Developer/Acme/Angular2/HelloApp
```

## STEP 3

```shell
git clone git@gitlab.com:exadra37-docker-images/angular-cli.git docker/angular-cli
```
